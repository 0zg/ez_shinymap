# mapmaker_simpel : upload your csv and visualize the map

Uses leaflet and has a data tab. 
Not much to say. You upload a CSV and get to see the lat-lon GPS plotted on a map.
Just a few configurations are available, so users don't experience choice-stress (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice#Why_we_suffer )
